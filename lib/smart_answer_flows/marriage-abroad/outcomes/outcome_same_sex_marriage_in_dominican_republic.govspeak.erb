  You’ll both need your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need either:

  - a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
  - the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

  ##What you need to do

  At your appointment the embassy or consulate will give you:

  - a notice of registration
  - a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry

  Once you’ve completed these and paid the registration fee, the embassy will display your notice publicly for 14 days.
  As long as nobody registers an objection you can get married up to 3 months after you gave notice.

  ^All same-sex marriages must take place under English and Welsh or Scottish law even if you live in or are from Northern Ireland. Tell the embassy or consulate which law you want to get married under at your appointment.^
