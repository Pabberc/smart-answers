  You’ll be asked to provide a ‘Nulla Osta’ by the authorities in Italy. This is a certificate that proves you’re allowed to marry.

  To get a Nulla Osta, you’ll first need to post notice of your intended marriage at the British Embassy in Rome.

  ###Applying for a Nulla Osta

  <%= render partial: "download_and_fill_notice_and_affidavit_but_not_sign.govspeak.erb" %>

  You will need to provide supporting documents, including:

    - your and your partner’s passport
    - your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
    - a utility bill, bank statement, official residency certificate, or driving license showing your name and Italian address (if you don’t normally live in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %> you can show a flight ticket or boarding pass with your date of entry or evidence of your hotel check-in)
    - evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll


  <%= render partial: 'consular_cni_os_not_uk_resident_ceremony_not_germany.govspeak.erb' %>

  You or your partner will also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence in the country where the divorce or dissolution took place, if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.


  ^If you’re a woman you must wait 300 days after divorcing or the death of your husband before remarrying.^

  ###What happens next

  The British embassy will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

  They'll issue your CNI within 5 working days of the end of the 7-day notice period (as long as nobody has registered an objection). You can collect your CNI in person or have it delivered by post.
