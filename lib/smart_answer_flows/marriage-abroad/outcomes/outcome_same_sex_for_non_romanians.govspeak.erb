  You’ll both need to bring your original passports. You’ll also need evidence that your partner is free to marry - a document from their government or their passport that says they are unmarried. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need to provide:

  - a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
  - the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

  At your appointment the embassy or consulate will give you:

  - a notice of registration
  - a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry

  Once you’ve completed these and paid the registration fee, the embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

  You’ll need to pay a fee to register your marriage and a fee for your marriage certificate.

  ^All same-sex marriages must take place under English and Welsh or Scottish law even if you live in or are from Northern Ireland. Tell the embassy or consulate which law you want to get married under at your appointment.^
